A Bullet-Hell, Rail-Shooter inspired game. Dodge the projectiles and destroy your enemies!

This game is a follow-along mini project, created in the process of learning Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D course on Udemy. The game's gameplay mechanics are mostly drawn from the project shown in the course. Furthermore, I personally added a few twists into the gameplay mechanics, which I believe will bring out more gaming excitement from the players.
